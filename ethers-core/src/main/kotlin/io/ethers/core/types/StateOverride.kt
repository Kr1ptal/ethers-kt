 * footguns when working with [AccountOverride]s which are mutable.
 *
 * To create a new instance, use:
 * - no-arg constructor, to create an empty instance,
 * - [StateOverride.wrap], to wrap an existing map without copying the data,
 * - [StateOverride.copy], to create a new instance from an existing map, creating a new copy of all [AccountOverride]s,
